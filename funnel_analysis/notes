Tableau Funnel analysis:

1) Create Calculated Field;
2) Set the negative measure, i.e. -[measure];
3) Sort ascending by the measure;
4) Put the dimension in Color;
5) Adjust the size to the maximum;
6) Entire view;
7) Adjust if there is any divider (borders) or grid lines (lines).
8) Done! (Pure funnel analysis chart is created!)
